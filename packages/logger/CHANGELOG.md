## 1.4.3

### Patch Changes

- 9bbf9ee5: Increased Vercel log limit to new value - 256KB. See [announcement](https://vercel.com/changelog/updated-logging-limits-for-vercel-functions) blog post from Vercel for more details.
- 9bbf9ee5: Fixed autofixable linting issues. No functional changes.

## 1.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 1e70b997: Fix Vercel runtime transport logs attribute order - attributes from logs context will be first so log attributes can override them.
- 83ad6531: Updated Node.js to 22.11

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 69992d56: Update modern-errors-serialize library so it supports excluding error property from serialization

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 92a2a5fd: If Vercel runtime transport log is exceeding Vercel log limit (4kb) error to Sentry will be logged as it won't be visible in log drain.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d088ef37: Renamed exported `logger` to `rootLogger` so we avoid collision of names when using `logger` in monorepo. Also `createLogger` function has been removed in favour of app defining it in their codebase.

### Patch Changes

- 2f37f075: Added `VercelBuildtimeTransport` which can be used to log information during Vercel build time e.g webhook migrations output. Renamed old `attachLoggerVercelTransport` to `attachLoggerVercelRuntimeTransport`.
- 6d528dc6: Added missing OTEL attributes to `loggerVercelTransport`. They will be visible under `otel` key in log collection service.

  Attributes:

  - `span_id`
  - `trace_id`
  - `timestamp`

## 1.2.10

### Patch Changes

- 6be0103c: Added new transport `LoggerVercelTransport`. It is currently in experimental stage but it can be used to send logs directly to Vercel log drain. This transport has optional argument of `loggerContext` - if used you need to make sure that function is executed only on the server. If attaching of transport fails we will get Sentry error.

  Usage:

  ```ts
  import { logger } from "@saleor/apps-logger";
  import { attachLoggerVercelTransport } from "@saleor/apps-logger/node";
  import { loggerContext } from "./logger-context";
  import pkgJson from "./package.json";

  attachLoggerVercelTransport(logger, pkgJson.version, loggerContext);
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 2683431: Added tests for Logger (console transport and otel transport).

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 93848f2: Improved logger implementation internals. Now it will inherit parent-logger attributes (only 1 level, which is internal tslog limitation). It uses custom console printer if attached, by default doesn't print anything, because built-in pretty print is limited and has to be disabled.

### Patch Changes

- 93848f2: Fixed mapping inherited attributes in logger to be sent via otel. Now, child logger attributes will be merged with each single log arguments

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 0849d8e: Extracted logger package, containing a Logger utility based on tslog package. It contains also transports for Otel and Sentry.
