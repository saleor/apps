### Patch Changes

- 148a6d7: Updated Sentry to 7.77.0

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 958dbcd: Changed how Contentful ID is created.

  Previously, Saleor's ID was used to create entry in Contentful.
  However, this implementation was failing when special characters in ID occurred (like "==").

  Now, entry in Contentful is created using it's own system ID, generated by Contentful itself.

  App will first query entries via variant ID field, so it still works without a breaking change.

  It's recommended to set "unique" parameter on variant ID field
