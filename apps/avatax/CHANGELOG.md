### Patch Changes

- f4250c1a: Fixed broken taxes resolving for billing address

## 1.10.3

### Patch Changes

  When enabled, app will required configured DynamoDB table. See readme for details.

  Client logs store business transactions in the persistent storage. Operations like taxes calculation or corresponding failures will be written.

  Logs can be accessed via App's configuration page in Saleor Dashboard.

### Patch Changes

- def3bb15: Fix Eslint issues. It won't affect AvaTax app functionality.
- dff6d8de: Improved error parser class constructor: now `parse` method will have optional parameter of error capture instead of constructor. This change will not have effect on clients.

- 3c974d3f: Attach orderId attribute to order-confirmed logs

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 4dc63f13: Implemented new discount strategy - for SHIPPING and SUBTOTAL values

  Now, App will do following logic:

  - For line items that represent products, we use [automatic distribution](https://developer.avalara.com/erp-integration-guide/sales-tax-badge/transactions/discounts-and-overrides/discounting-a-transaction/), so App will not modify amounts, but will mark lines as "discounted: true" and generate "discount" field that will sum all relevant discounts
  - For shipping line item, app will use [price reduction](https://developer.avalara.com/erp-integration-guide/sales-tax-badge/transactions/discounts-and-overrides/discounting-a-transaction/), meaning shipping line will _not_ be marked as discounted, but the discount will be subtracted from the amount of the shipping line.

  See updated docs [here](https://docs.saleor.io/developer/app-store/apps/avatax/configuration#discounts)

- f803af6b: Minimal required Saleor version has been upgraded and now it's 3.19.

- e03f703f: Added extra error handling for Public Metadata mutation of the Order.

## 1.8.3

### Patch Changes

- 8fb5ea61: Migrate from country select into country combobox when configuring AvaTax app. It should be easier to search for countries instead of selecting them from long list.

  - The tax rate for such lines will always be 0.

  ### Before:

  When AvaTax failed to respond, app left Tax Code Matcher page and settings couldn't been set

- 5670c6ed: Send JSON instead of string when webhook has non 200 response. This will help Saleor in displaying better logs.

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- ba981a73: Fixed discount logic. After this change AvaTax app will send Saleor discounts to Avalara for automatic distribution when handling calculate taxes webhook for order and checkout.

- Updated dependencies [6f2d6abb]
  - @saleor/apps-otel@1.3.0

## 1.6.3

- 1a9912f5: Setup Sentry inside Next.js instrumentation file. It ensures that Sentry works properly for serverless environment.

### Patch Changes

  1. Checkout or Order metadata (`avataxCustomerCode` key).

  3. User id.
  4. As a fallback app sends `0` to Avatax.
- a82631f0: Added more logging for Avatax app tax code matcher. App now is more explicit and sends `P0000000` as default tax class id to Avatax.
- 3c6ff94d: Improve logging for AvataxCustomerCodeResolver.
- a5ef57cc: Attach Sentry to tRPC errors. This will help us with catching unhandled exceptions.

## 1.4.1

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 5f86c2e7: Fixed bug when app sends wrong information to Avatax indicating if tax is included in prices. After this change app will get this information from Saleor.

### Patch Changes

- 95d3b9e6: Avatax app now has new e2e tests for channels that have `pricesEnteredWithTax: True`. The tests include order and checkout creation.
- 0b158170: Fixed issue when `totalPrice` was set to 0 when checkout did not have address. After this change app will return `totalPrice` as fallback for `gross` and `net` so storefront user won't be confused with prices being 0.

- 04a11abd: Avatax app no longer creates new transactions if Saleor is set to use flat rates.

- Updated dependencies [f7ecb7bd]
  - @saleor/apps-logger@1.2.1

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4f2c17c0: Added caching to App Metadata. Now, when webhook is called by Saleor, metadata from payload will be cached and consumed in MetadataManager. If cache doesn't exist, MetadataManager will fetch missing metadata. This change removes unnecessary graphql call that was timing out the handler.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a4d35fe8: Removed "Client Logs" feature. It was effectively breaking taxes calculation, because it performed heavy data+network operations during short time period of a webhook execution.

### Patch Changes

- c6e6c1f2: Cleanup `WebhookResponse.error` function - now it won't capture exception to Sentry. Instead you should use `Sentry.captureException` explicitly when there is unhandled exception.
- e3c44c5e: Changed maximum timeout on Avatax client calls to 15s from 5s

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b29318a2: Currently, Dashboard requires from a user to have "MANAGE_APPS" to have access to the apps tab.
  Since the release 3.20 Dashboard will allow all users to access to apps tabs without checking permission.
  This means that apps will be checking if the user has "MANAGE_APPS" internally and show message "You do not have permission to access this page" if the user does not have the permission.
- 0f1a38d1: Avatax app will now send `productVariantId` from `OrderLine` to Avatax if there is no `productSku` while processing `ORDER_CREATED` webhook.

### Patch Changes

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- fa478d2b: Gracefully handle cases, where checkout/order in webhooks misses address and/or lines. These scenarios are possible when app is reached with partial checkout/order. It can happen when user haven't yet entered address or added lines. App will check this and return proper error with status 400
- 1e07a6ff: Applied "logger context" that allows api handlers to share fields in the invocation context. It helps to avoid "prop drilling". This context will be sent with Open Telemetry logs attributes
- cb620765: Unified the shipping line logic. Reading and creating a shipping line is now in `avatax-shipping-line.ts`.
- Updated dependencies [1e07a6ff]
  - @saleor/apps-logger@1.2.0

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 0f3e6fbe: Improved error handling in CHECKOUT_CALCULATE_TAXES flow. After this change, errors logged will have better, more verbose structure. Messages sent to Saleor will be also more self explaining

- Updated dependencies [67afe8e4]
- Updated dependencies [67afe8e4]
