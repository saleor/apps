## Local development setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v22+
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) v10+

### Running app locally in development containers

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can use devcontainer Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml directly - but remember to run `pnpm install` manually

The easiest way of running Saleor for local development is to use [development containers](https://containers.dev/).
If you have Visual Studio Code follow their [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container) on how to open existing folder in container.

Development container only creates container, you still need to start the server.

Development container will have two ports opened:

1. `3000` - were app dev server will listen to requests

### Running app in development mode

1. Install the dependencies by running the following command in the shell:

```shell
pnpm install
```

2. Create a file named `.env` and use the contents of the [`.env.example`](./.env.example) file as a reference.

3. Start the development server by running the following command in the shell:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

4. App will be available under `http://localhost:3000`

> [!NOTE]
> To install app in Saleor Cloud, you need to expose your local server to the internet (tunnel). You can use Saleor CLI to do that. See this [guide](https://docs.saleor.io/developer/extending/apps/developing-with-tunnels) for more details.

6. Install app on the Saleor dashboard.

### Bruno

[Bruno](https://docs.usebruno.com/) is an open source tool for exploring and testing APIs. It's similar to Postman or Insomnia.

This app has a collection of requests to Saleor that allows to pay for checkout with NP Atobarai app.

To get started create `.env` file based on `.env.example` inside `apps/np-atobarai/bruno` folder.

# DynamoDB

DynamoDB is used to store app's configuration. To develop this feature locally use development containers or use [docker-compose](../../.devcontainer/np-atobarai/docker-compose.yml) from `.devcontainer`:

1. Run `docker compose up dynamodb` for local DynamoDB instance
2. Run `pnpm run setup-dynamodb` to describe DynamoDB table

Ensure following env variables are set:

```dotenv
TABLE_NAME=np-atobarai-main-table # must match scripts/setup-dynamodb.ts
AWS_REGION=localhost
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:8000
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```

Alternatively, you can connect to AWS-based DynamoDB:

1. Create table in your AWS, based on parameters in [`scripts/setup-dynamodb.ts`](./scripts/setup-dynamodb.ts)
2. Set AWS-specific [env variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-environment.html)
