# Local development variables. When developped locally with Saleor inside docker, these can be set to:
# APP_IFRAME_BASE_URL = http://localhost:3000, so Dashboard on host can access iframe
# APP_API_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3000 - so Saleor can reach App running on host, from the container.
# If developped with tunnels, set this empty, it will fallback to default Next's localhost:3000
