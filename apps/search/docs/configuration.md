3. Copy the Application ID and Admin API Key

### Grouping

To provide the most precise search results at the variant level, the Search app uploads each variant as a separate document. You will likely want to group results by product. To achieve this, navigate to the index settings:

At the menu on the left, choose `Deduplication and Grouping`. Change the value of distinct to `true` and set the attribute as `productId`. If the attribute is not there, make sure you have already reindexed your products.

After saving the changes, variants will be displayed as a single product:
