# saleor-app-search

## 1.22.20

### Patch Changes

- 0db174a8: Removed regex escape for `ALLOWED_DOMAINS_URL` env variable from register handler. It isn't user input and escaping regex was causing problem with apps installation.

## 1.22.19

### Patch Changes

- 9bbf9ee5: Increased Vercel log limit to new value - 256KB. See [announcement](https://vercel.com/changelog/updated-logging-limits-for-vercel-functions) blog post from Vercel for more details.
- 9bbf9ee5: Added new `LoggerVercelTransport` support. It will help us send logs to our infrastructure without need of OTEL unstable logs API.
- 9bbf9ee5: Escape ALLOWED_DOMAIN_PATTERN regex. It ensures that regex constructed from env variable is sanitized and can't be used to Denial of Service attack.
- 9bbf9ee5: Fixed autofixable linting issues. No functional changes.

### Patch Changes

- fe5d5d5e: Updated @saleor/app-sdk to 0.50.3. This version removes the limitation of body size for the webhook payloads.

## 1.22.10

### Patch Changes

- f57cd9b9: Now flag the "bundlePagesExternals" is enabled. This means cold-run can be reduced accordingly to Vercel recommendation.
- 77329589: The initial import of product to algolia is no longer stuck while processing. This means the UI now informs you when the upload is finished.
- 2c185816: Active webhooks are no longer disabling themselves when running migrations. This means when some webhook is active, migration will turn on all of them.

### Patch Changes

- 9441359a: Search app now logs warnings when authData is missing. Logged errors in webhook handlers that had the same messages have been changed, meaning that debugging is now easier.

## 1.22.7

### Patch Changes

- 3be6fa18: The feature allowing app to disable its own webhooks was removed. Initially it was designed to update webhooks after the new version of the app (with new webhooks) was released.
  Now, app contains migration script that runs on the deployment and webhooks are automatically recreated, so the feature is no longer needed.

## 1.22.6

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [6f2d6abb]
  - @saleor/apps-otel@1.3.0

## 1.22.3

### Patch Changes

- fbdbaa28: Remove custom Next.js + Sentry error. It was causing non existing paths to be reported as 500 instead of 404. We catch Sentry errors in implicit anyway in api routes.
- Updated dependencies [fbdbaa28]
  - @saleor/sentry-utils@0.2.2

## 1.22.2

### Patch Changes

- 00cdf64b: Added packages optimization, via Next.js configuration. This should decrease cold starts due to smaller bundle size
- 2f59041c: Reverted shared Sentry configuration (init() part). It was not working properly - source maps were not properly assigned. Now configuration is not shared, but repeated in every app separately
- Updated dependencies [2f59041c]
  - @saleor/sentry-utils@0.2.1

## 1.22.1

## 1.22.0

### Minor Changes

- c4dcb863: Remove Pino logger library. It was already deprecated but for non migrated apps it was causing build errors. Right now we have one logger - @saleor/app-logger pkg.
- 1a9912f5: Setup Sentry inside Next.js instrumentation file. It ensures that Sentry works properly for serverless environment.
- b9957b11: Removed the functionality that automatically disabled webhooks when Algolia responded with errors.
  This behavior was unstable, and we received reports that webhooks were being randomly disabled, even when the credentials were correct.

  To ensure apps operate reliably, webhooks are now managed as follows:

  - After installation, if the app is not configured, webhooks are disabled.
  - When the configuration is saved, the app validates Algolia credentials. Invalid credentials cannot be saved.
  - Once valid credentials are saved, webhooks are enabled.
  - Webhooks will remain enabled, even if tokens are rotated.

### Patch Changes

- b9957b11: Wrapped API routes with logger context utility. Now it will pass all attributes down to every log emitted during the request. It automatically adds attributes like saleorApiUrl or event to OTEL logs
- 37ecb246: Update pnpm to 9.2.0 version. It means that we also dropped support for Node.js less than 16.
- cc047b1d: Downgraded Sentry package to v7. Previous upgrade to 8.x cause Sentry to conflict with Open Telemetry setup and Sentry was not working

## 1.21.0

### Minor Changes

- b29318a2: Currently, Dashboard requires from a user to have "MANAGE_APPS" to have access to the apps tab.
  Since the release 3.20 Dashboard will allow all users to access to apps tabs without checking permission.
  This means that apps will be checking if the user has "MANAGE_APPS" internally and show message "You do not have permission to access this page" if the user does not have the permission.

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 69fe973: Extended search model with two new fields:

## 1.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 2cb7e5e: Improved attributes mapping. Now Algolia will receive better products data:
  - Added `otherVariants` field which is _an array of variant id strings_. It will only contain other variants, so if the array is empty, it means the variant is the only one. It can be quickly used to count alternative variants or to reference them by ID.
  - Added `variantMetadata` field. Now `metadata` contains data for product parent and `variantMetadata` for each variant.
  - Improved JSON fields mapping. Now json-like fields will be sent to Algolia as structure jsons, not strings. This include: `description`, `metadata`, `variantMetadata`, `otherVariants`.
