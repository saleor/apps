## 1.18.1

### Patch Changes

- 6720d01: Fixed the issue when the app threw errors when unable to resolve user email. Now, if the email is not available in `order.user.email` and `order.userEmail`, the app will fall back to empty string.

## 1.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 72b4fba: Fixed the issue with the app throwing errors when no customer code was resolved in AvaTax integration. Now, it falls back to "0" which is the recommended dummy value for when it's impossible to identify a customer (e.g. in an anonymous checkout).

## 1.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 07d7d09: Improved the Sentry setup. When Sentry is successfully configured, the app should report all the events accordingly to the severity specified in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_REPORT_LEVEL`. All the errors now have a new property: `sentrySeverity`. The app now uses new environment variables: `VERCEL`, `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_REPORT_LEVEL` and `GITHUB_SHA`. To ensure the correct building of source maps, before performing a deploy to Vercel build, the app will now provide the release tag in a `SENTRY_RELEASE` env var.

## 1.16.1

### Patch Changes

- a561cb8: Fixed the issue with client logger freezing while parsing logs. Now, the logs are limited to 10 failed events.
- 949a4f5: Refactored error handling. The app now distinguishes between different types of errors:

  - `TaxIncompleteWebhookPayloadError` - thrown when data in the webhook payload is not complete enough to continue with the process.
  - `TaxBadPayloadError` - thrown when the webhook payload is not what the app expects.
  - `TaxBadProviderResponseError` - thrown when the response from the tax provider is not what the app expects.
  - `TaxExternalError` - thrown when the tax provider returns an error.

## 1.16.0

### Minor Changes

- a32fe7c: Added logs for AvaTax and TaxJar. Logs are stored in the app metadata. Only the last 100 events are stored. Each provider configuration has its own logs. You can get to them by a new button "Logs" in the provider table.

### Patch Changes

### Patch Changes

- 34efd39: Fixed the issue when user id was not available during tax calculation. Now, to identify the user during tax calculation, we use the user email.
- 45ed9fb: Fixed the error when checkout couldn't calculate taxes when no customerCode was provided. In calculate taxes, the customerCode is now derived from issuingPrincipal's id.

## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- be761b2: Changed the layout in the AvaTax configuration form to consist of three sections: "Credentials", "Settings" (new) and "Address". Now, the "Credentials" section contains only fields that affect authentication.

## 1.13.1

### Patch Changes

- 3002354: Added error logging for exceptions thrown at tRPC routes.

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 416c92f: Changed `externalId` order metadata field to `avataxId`. It is now only responsible for storing the id of Avatax transaction.
- 416c92f: Added support for reading document code from metadata field `avataxDocumentCode`. The default value is the order id from Saleor. The value for the document code is sliced to be under 20 characters. The requirement comes from Avatax API.
- 416c92f: Added support for reading the tax calculation date from metadata field `avataxTaxCalculationDate`. The value has to be valid UTC datetime string (e.g. "2021-08-31T13:00:00.000Z").
- 416c92f: Added `ORDER_CANCELLED` webhook handler with an implementation for Avatax. The transactions for corresponding orders in Saleor will be voided in the Avatax dashboard.
- 416c92f: Started the migration from `OrderCreated` to `OrderConfirmed` webhook event. In the new flow, the provider transactions will be created based on the order confirmation (either automatic or manual) event. The value of the `commit` field will be set based on the "isAutocommit" setting in the provider configuration.

  The `OrderCreated` and `OrderFulfilled` handlers are deprecated. They will be removed on August 24, along with their corresponding webhooks. For now, both flows (`OrderCreated` -> `OrderFulfilled` and `OrderConfirmed`) are supported.

  **Actions needed**:

  The only scenario where you, as the user, may need to do something regarding this release is the following:

  1. You created an order that still needs to be fulfilled (therefore, the corresponding AvaTax transaction is not committed).
  2. You are planning to fulfill the order after August 23 (which is the date when we will complete the migration).

  In that case, **remember you will not be able to commit the transaction by fulfilling the order in Saleor**. In the new flow, the transactions are committed in AvaTax while confirming the Saleor order, based on the "isAutocommit" flag. What you have to do is the following:

  1. Make sure "isAutocommit" is set to true.
  2. Trigger the `OrderConfirmed` event (either by [`orderConfirm` mutation](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-confirm) or in the Dashboard).

  The AvaTax transaction created on the `OrderCreated` event should be updated with `commit: true`.

  You can read more about the webhook flow in the Taxes App and the migration itself in [our documentation](https://saleor-docs-git-taxes-order-created-to-confirmed-saleorcommerce.vercel.app/docs/3.x/developer/app-store/apps/taxes/architecture#migration).

## 1.12.0

### Minor Changes

- a725720: Added the possibility to pass entityUseCode as order `avataxEntityCode` metadata field. This makes tax exempting groups of customers possible.

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- ce60887: Added "document recording" toggle. It is turned on by default. When turned off, the document type of all Avatax transactions change to "SalesOrder", making them not record. Read more about document recording [here](https://developer.avalara.com/ecommerce-integration-guide/sales-tax-badge/designing/disable-document-recording/).
- 5a4da7b: Changed the avatax configuration flow. Previously, the configuration was validated when trying to create it. Now, you have to verify the credentials and address manually by clicking the "verify" buttons. If the address was resolved successfully, formatting suggestions provided by Avatax address resolution service may be displayed. The user can apply or reject the suggestions. If the address was not resolved correctly, an error will be thrown.

### Minor Changes

- ca43061: Adds new way of distributing discounts on items (proportional). Adds distinguishment between when TaxJar nexus was found and was not. Now, the "not found" behavior is not treated as error, and will return untaxed values. Fixes bugs: item quantity in TaxJar; when shipping = 0; pricesEnteredWithTax influences shipping price.

- 23b5c70: Set minimum Saleor version where app can be installed (3.9).

  Previously, app could have been installed in any Saleor, but if required taxes APIs were missing, app would crash

  Now, Saleor will reject installation if possible. If Saleor can't do it, App will check Saleor version during installation and fail it if version doesn't match

- dd799e6: Adds `resolveOptionalOrThrow` util that throws when not able to resolve an optional value. Now, when critical values from external APIs are not found, the app will crash instead of falling back to 0s.

### Patch Changes

- 70bf546: Fix the calculations of shipping price and line prices based on the `pricesEnteredWithTax` value. Before, the Tax App didn't consider the `pricesEnteredWithTax` setting. Now, it will return different values for `pricesEnteredWithTax` true/false.
