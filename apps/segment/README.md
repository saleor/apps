## Local development setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v22+
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) v10+
- An account on [Twilio Segment](https://segment.com/) with configured [source](https://segment.com/docs/partners/sources/).

### Running app locally in development containers

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can use devcontainer Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml directly - but remember to run `pnpm install` and `./scripts/setup-dynamodb.sh` manually

The easiest way of running Saleor for local development is to use [development containers](https://containers.dev/).
If you have Visual Studio Code follow their [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container) on how to open existing folder in container.

Development container only creates container, you still need to start the server.

Development container will have two ports opened:

1. `3000` - were app dev server will listen to requests
2. `8000` - were local DynamoDB will listen to requests and allow [NoSQL Workbench for DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/workbench.html) to connect

### Running app in development mode

1. Install the dependencies by running the following command in the shell:

```shell
pnpm install
```

2. Create a file named `.env` and use the contents of the [`.env.example`](./.env.example) file as a reference.

3. Start the development server by running the following command in the shell:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

4. App will be available under `http://localhost:3000`

> [!NOTE]
> To install app in Saleor Cloud, you need to expose your local server to the internet (tunnel). You can use Saleor CLI to do that. See this [guide](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/apps/developing-with-tunnels) for more details.

6. Install app on the Saleor dashboard.
7. After installation, configure the app as follows:
   - Paste [`writeKey`](https://segment.com/docs/connections/find-writekey/) into app configuration form

### Webhook migration scripts

> [!NOTE]
> This section refers to apps hosted by Saleor or using REST APL. If you self host AvaTax app you need to write your own logic for updating migration scripts.
> See [How to update app webhooks](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/apps/updating-app-webhooks) for more info.

You need to set `REST_APL_TOKEN` & `REST_APL_ENDPOINT` in our `.env` file first.

Test migration with dry run, operation will not modify any data:

```bash
pnpm migrate:dry-run
```

To start the migration run command:

```bash
pnpm migrate
```

### Setting up DynamoDB

Segment app uses DynamoDB as it's internal database.

In order to work properly you need to either set-up local DynamoDB instance or connect to a real DynamoDB on AWS account.

#### Local DynamoDB

To use a local DynamoDB instance you can use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up
```

After that a local DynamoDB instance will be spun-up at `http://localhost:8000`.

To set up tables needed for the app run following command for each table used in app:

```shell
./scripts/setup-dynamodb.sh
```

After setting up database, you must configure following variables:

```bash
DYNAMODB_MAIN_TABLE_NAME=segment-main-table
AWS_REGION=localhost
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:8000
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=fake_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=fake_key
```

Local instance doesn't require providing any authentication details.

To see data stored by the app you can use [NoSQL Workbench](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/workbench.html) app provided by AWS. After installing the app go to Operation builder > Add connection > DynamoDB local and use the default values.

#### Production DynamoDB

To configure DynamoDB for production usage, provide credentials in a default AWS SDK format (see [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-environment.html))

```bash
DYNAMODB_MAIN_TABLE_NAME=segment-main-table
AWS_REGION=us-east-1 # Region when DynamoDB was deployed
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AK...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

## OTEL

Visit `@saleor/apps-otel` [README](../../packages/otel/README.md) to learn how to run app with OTEL locally.
