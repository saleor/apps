# Additional variables for the app - not needed to start the app

# APL=file # tells app where to keep its credentials
# FILE_APL_PATH= # path to the file with credentials (if APL is set to file). It can be relative to the specific app main folder e.g ./auth/credentials.json. If not set, default will be used
# APP_LOG_LEVEL=info # one of "fatal" | "error" | "warn" | "info" | "debug" | "trace"

# Local development variables. When developed locally with Saleor inside docker, these can be set to:

# APP_IFRAME_BASE_URL = http://localhost:3000, so Dashboard on host can access iframe
# APP_API_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3000 - so Saleor can reach App running on host, from the container.
# If developed with tunnels, set this empty, it will fallback to default Next's localhost:3000
